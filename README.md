# drkhrse 1:1 RGB30 Bezels
My 1:1 aspect ratio 720p portable system bezels for Retroarch. Currently a WIP with more setup instructions added later.

Originally created for the RGB30.

Open game and then go to the [Quick Menu](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Global-Shortcuts) for Retroarch (Select + X buttons) > On-Screen Overlay > Overlay Preset > Choose cfg file. Save the override on the content folder or per game basis.
